I am very glad you have expressed interest in this guide! Having up to date information increases the safety and reliability of this guide.


### Markdown Formatting
In this project, when writing Markdown please write all of thee contents on a single line. The reasoning behind this decision is because most text editors will automatically return the content if the text is too long.

Another reason behind this is because it makes editing harder. If you need to insert something then everything is shifted to the side and you will have to reorganize your content again.


### Footnotes
Providing sources is very important as it allows me to understand related content that you might submit, of course this isn't always necessary but is always welcome. I like to format my footnotes like the following:

```markdown
# WireGuard
WireGuard is a free open source VPN[^1].

[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WireGuard 
```

I don't put the footnotes at the bottom of the Markdown document, instead after the paragraph or related content. This makes it more easy to group content when editing.

As for the styling I am not too fussy, as long as it has the relevant information. Sometimes you don't even need to cite, you can use Markdown's link function `[link](www.google.com)` instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Eventually the styling will change and be more uniformed. Though, I don't think it is important at the moment. 


### Sections
Please leave two lines between the end of a section and the start of a new section:

```markdown
paragraphs ends here

### New Section 
```

This isn't necessary between paragraphs where a single line break is fine.

```markdown
paragraph

paragraph
```

### Commit Messages
I would like commit messages to start with lowercase. Though, if by habit you accidentally put it as uppercase, you don't have to rebase or append. You can see in my commit history a mixture of upper and lowercase commits trying to abide by this rule. So it's no big deal.
